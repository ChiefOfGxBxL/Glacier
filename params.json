It contains the maps that are published on Glacier, and the modules (dependencies) that those maps can use. The client downloads all of those files from this repo.\r\n\r\n### What is Glacier?\r\nGlacier is a WC3 suite that is built on top of SharpCraft. Essentially, it loads .dll's into the game. At a bigger picture, this means that map developers can leverage virtually any functionality that can be written in C#, the language SharpCraft and the .dll's are written in.\r\n\r\n### What does it mean for me?\r\nMap developers have long had to make maps with certain limitations: no control over networking, no filesystem or I/O, etc. That ends today. Glacier is a gaming client that manages maps (much like Steam), and sets the user up with the needed dependencies automatically. \r\n\r\nMaps will utilize amazing new functionality including:\r\n * a file system API that allows maps to read and write data (e.g. save codes, units, heroes, etc.), \r\n * add external resources such as large audio files without importing them into the map, and \r\n * fine-tune networking which can by-pass B.Net servers, therefore allowing unlimited # of players, re-sync, real-time games, and\r\n * **much, much more!**\r\n\r\n### How do I get started?\r\n(We're currently working very hard to develop the client and will post it soon. The application is cross-platform.)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGlacier is written by @chiefofgxbxl.  \r\nExperimental map design and JASS ports written by @derdan.  \r\nSharpCraft is written by MindWorX on The Hive.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n(We're working on public documentation and the wiki. If you need anything for now, PM @chiefofgxbxl)\r\n",
